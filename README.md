🏋️ **Weekly Workout Tracker**

A simple and easy-to-use workout tracking app built with React Native and Expo.
This app helps you plan and track your weekly workouts — without any complicated menus or confusing layouts. Just open it, add your exercises, and start training.

🧠 **Why I Built This App?**

I usually use the built-in note-taking app on my phone to organize my workout routine. I want to make an app that be able to organize my workout and also make it beginner-friendly. 
Weekly Workout Tracker was made to keep things as easy to use and help you focus on the workout over using a complicated app.

✨ **Features**

- 7-Day Workout Plan — Add and organize exercises for each day of the week.
- Exercise Storage — Every day has its own stored exercise list using AsyncStorage.
- Set Tracking — Track your workout sets easily with built-in set counters.
- Quick Add — Browse exercises from the ExerciseDB API and add them directly to your day.
- Simple UI — Clean, lightweight, and distraction-free design focused on usability.

 🛠️ **Tech Stack**

- React Native
- Expo Router
- AsyncStorage for local data persistence
- ExerciseDB API (via RapidAPI) for exercise data
- Expo Checkbox for set tracking
